# Fly Distributed Systems Challenges

This are my Go solutions for fly.io distributed systems challenges: 
https://fly.io/dist-sys/.

I encourage you to build your own solutions in another language since
the Malestrom protocol is pretty simple:
https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/protocol.md.

Also, while you are at it, pick a functional language and save yourself
the pain of mutable state (been there, done that).
